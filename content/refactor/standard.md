# Defining an standard

Defining an standard is a crucial part of making a refactor. One of the easiest ways to ruin a improvement in the code is by not following an standard.

## Why is so important?

It is important because by following a standard, you ensure that the same solution is used for the same problem. If every time the same problem arises is solved using the same solution, it helps the developers not to think of the solution in a low level detail, but a high level one. This leaves the developer free to pay attention to the problems that are not solved yet. In the same note, if for some reason the solution needs to change, it will be changed in one place only and reflected across the whole app.

Another benefit of following an standard is that when code is written by many different people and someone needs to work on some piece of code he didn't write, it will be easier for him to understand everything since the standards the former developer followed are known.
