# Modularizing the app

Modularizing the app will reduce the complexity of the css, since you'll have small little pieces of css and will increase the reusability. If you're thinking of a refactor and start over some important parts of the app, definetely modularization is the way you'd want to go.

## What do we mean when we talk about `modularization`

When we say modularization we mean reducing the complexity of the app by diving it in small modules or components (usually, they're referred to as components in css).
