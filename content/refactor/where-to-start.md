# Where do i start?

Let's imagine you have already set up the new standards, figured out how to make the old and new stuff coexist and identified which components your app will need. Now it's time to actually start coding!

Following these steps will probably help you to organize the process:

1. Define the folder structure
2. Start with your base styles. Do `<li>`s have bullets? Do all the elements have an specific `box-sizing` value?
3. Define the base markup of your app (if you are changing the HTML as well). One wrapper for the app, one wrapper for the content, a navbar, a header, a footer.
4. Create the css to layout the app at a high level.
5. Create the css to layout each page of your app
6. Implement the components needed for each page
